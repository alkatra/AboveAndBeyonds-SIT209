# Above and Beyond Web Development Assignments

The Above and Beyonds repository contains a collection of complex, practical tasks (given on a Web Development class) designed to build and test my proficiency in web development, front-end technologies, REST APIs, and testing using Node.js, Jest, and Axios. Each assignment extended my knowledge by requiring the application of advanced concepts in real-world scenarios.

**Assignment 1 - Responsive IoT Application Site**: Create a responsive website using Bootstrap 4, detailing the use of IoT applications and necessary skillsets to develop these applications.

**Assignment 2 - Smart-Lighting Digital Twin**: Build a digital twin of a smart-lighting system in a web application, which allows the user to interact with multiple lights and their colors.

**Assignment 3 - Smart Car Control Panel**: Develop a control panel for a smart car as a website, complete with user authentication and user-specific car information.

**Assignment 4 - GitHub Repository Statistics**: Construct a website that interacts with GitHub's REST API to fetch and present statistical data about specific GitHub repositories.

**Assignment 5 - OpenStreetMap API Testing**: Write a series of tests for the OpenStreetMap API using Node.js, Jest, and Axios. Implement a variety of tests for different query types and data sets.

Each assignment focuses on a unique aspect of web development, from front-end development with Bootstrap 4 and jQuery, backend interaction with APIs, to testing with Jest and Axios. They are designed to challenge and push you "Above and Beyond" the typical expectations of a web developer.
